The solution involves several steps:

1. **Check Package Versions:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect your dependency tree and identify any version conflicts. Pay close attention to native modules and their dependencies.
2. **Update Dependencies:** Ensure all packages are updated to their latest compatible versions. Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update your dependencies. If you have native modules, this might require manual updates according to their specific instructions. 
3. **Clean Project Cache:** Sometimes, cached packages can lead to persistent errors. Try these steps:
    -  `rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf yarn.lock && npm install` or `yarn install --force` (For Yarn).
    -  Clean the Xcode project (if applicable) by deleting the derived data folder.
4. **Use Version Range:**  Use version ranges in your package.json to ensure compatibility but not allow for too wide of variations that could cause compatibility issues.  For example, specify `"react-native-xyz": "^1.0.0"` instead of a specific version number if the XYZ native module is prone to incompatibility with certain versions of RN. 
5. **Check for Compatibility Notes:** Carefully review the documentation of any third-party libraries you use to check for known compatibility issues or specific requirements regarding React Native and other native module versions.  

By addressing version conflicts and cleaning up the project's cache, you can typically resolve this type of error.
