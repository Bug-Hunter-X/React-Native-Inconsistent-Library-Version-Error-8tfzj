# React Native Inconsistent Library Version Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet often difficult-to-diagnose error in React Native projects: inconsistencies in library or native module versions.  The error manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes, often without clear error messages.

## Problem
Using incompatible versions of libraries or mismatched native modules can lead to runtime errors that are hard to trace.  This can stem from using outdated dependencies, incorrect dependency resolution, or conflicts between different packages.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking your package versions, ensuring compatibility across your dependencies, and cleaning your project's cache.  Using a consistent versioning strategy (e.g., semantic versioning) and tools like `npm-check-updates` can help prevent these issues.

This example uses a hypothetical scenario where conflicting versions of a native module cause a crash.  The solution focuses on version alignment and cache cleanup.
